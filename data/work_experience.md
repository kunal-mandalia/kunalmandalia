## MarketInvoice
**Frontend Developer | React, Next.js**
*Apr 2017 - Feb 2018 � 11 months*
*London, United Kingdom*

I help the Acquisition Team to make sure SMEs and Investors have a great experience when visiting MarketInvoice.com by building beautiful web pages and components with clean testable code in modern technologies. Grateful to work alongside such smart, welcoming folks.

**Tech stack:** React.js / Redux on the frontend, Node.js on the backend, wrapped up in Next.js for universal rendering. Jest / Enzyme for unit tests, Selenium Webdriver / Mocha for end to end tests. Travis CI for Continuous Integration. Git / Github for source control and managing product releases. AWS EBS / S3 for cloud hosting and load balancing.

**Highlights:**
- Lead the change in architecture on marketinvoice.com while working closely with the Marketing team on brand and the wider engineering team on best practice. We were going through a rebrand and decided that since most content will be changing, now is the right time to consider upgrading our tech stack. We made the decision to build marketinvoice.com from the ground up using Next.js / React / Redux / Node / Webpack after evaluating a prototype which I delivered a public talk about. Over 1,200 commits, 400 tests, and hundreds of components later and the new site now loads 50% faster, navigates 6x faster page to page, presents our brand cleanly and elegantly, and is a dream to develop on
- Adapted the signup process for SMEs seeking a business loan, allowing companies to apply regardless of their accounting software. Frontend TDD involved new React containers / stateless components to capture financials, Routing to channel the flow, and Redux to manage state. Backend development involved altering existing .NET endpoints and DB migrations to ensure our SQL db had the correct schema to capture additional financials

## Brett Martin Daylight Systems
**IT Systems Analyst**
*Aug 2012 - Dec 2015 � 3 years 5 months*
*Coventry, United Kingdom*

Tasked with improving the business through better use of technology, I wore many hats related to IT from being the software engineer to delivering training and workshops. After three and a half years here's the highlights:

**Highlights:**
- Lead the development of Profile Finder as part of a dedicated team of three; an industry first public tool to help roofing contractors identify and order correctly sized plastic roofing sheets. Our customers (and competitors) love it. Computer generated SVG representations of roof profiles based on their dimensions means we've been able to share over 1000 profiles with the industry. We open sourced our helper library to draw measurements on SVG on Github too
- Lead the development & maintenance of Assembly Scheduler; an application used daily by the production team to schedule the days production run and track the team's performance. It was used effectively in 1 to 1s too and the insights it offered made operators feel their efforts were being fairly acknowledged
- KnowledgeBase; championed different departments to open up and share core processes and assets via SharePoint, training team leaders where required and running workshops. Gaining control over engineering drawings in particular was effective as it helped open up our technical assets to our sales team
- CRM development and support; lead the development of adapting our quotes generated from Dynamics CRM to accommodate commercial partnerships, tying together process and brand
