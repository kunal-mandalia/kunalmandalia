# Website Summary

This is a **personal portfolio website** for Kunal Mandalia styled as an interactive hacker-themed terminal. The site features:

- **Terminal UI** (Terminal.tsx) - A retro green-on-black command-line interface with a blinking cursor
- **Interactive commands**: `help`, `ls`, `cat`, `projects`, `resume`, `echo`, `clear`, `contact`, `pwd`, `cd`
- **Portfolio content**:
  - Resume showing Senior Software Engineer (JS/TS) experience with Next.js, Tailwind, Python
  - Projects: Scheduler, Drive Tutor, Rental Reporter (currently placeholder links)
  - Contact information (placeholder email)
- **Features**: Command history (arrow keys), keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+C), auto-scrolling output

The home page renders the Terminal component directly, creating an immersive CLI experience as the entire landing page.
